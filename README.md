- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I loved doing css animation. It is small and may be not fitting current setting, but i made it and i love it dearly because it looks so very natural and realistic.

'''
  @keyframes closing-door {

    0%, 5% {
      transform: rotateY(90deg);
      animation-timing-function: ease-in;
      transform-origin: left;
    }

    38%,
    73%,
    90%,
    100% {
      transform: rotateY(0);
      animation-timing-function: ease-out;
      transform-origin: left;
    }

    58% {
      transform: rotateY(30deg);
      animation-timing-function: ease-in;
      transform-origin: left;
    }

    83% {
      transform: rotateY(15deg);
      animation-timing-function: ease-in;
      transform-origin: left;
    }

    95% {
      transform: rotateY(5deg);
      animation-timing-function: ease-in;
      transform-origin: left;
    }
  }

### Continued development

I will learn more on creating different layouts, more on accessability and semantics in html, more on js and animations.
